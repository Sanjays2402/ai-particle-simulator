# ai-particle-simulator — autoship STATE

Owner-of-record (cron): Cake (cron) `51058514+Sanjays2402@users.noreply.github.com`
Branch: **feature/autoship** (off local main HEAD at 169b31b)
Never merge to main, never tag, never open PRs. Quality gate ONCE per batch.

## App snapshot (so future ticks don't re-read the world)

React 19 + Vite + Three.js + R3F + Drei + EffectComposer (bloom/CA/vignette/noise).
Zustand store (`src/store.js`) holds simulation, UI, AI, persistence.
Per-frame loop in `src/components/ParticleCanvas.jsx` (`Particles` mesh):
  walks every particle, calls compiled preset fn, applies physics, mouse-attract,
  paint attractors, audio scaling, theme hue shift, gradient palette tint.

Existing capabilities (do not re-ship):
- 46 presets, 11 themes + user-authored custom themes, 6 visual styles, 4 force-field types
- Audio reactivity (level / bass / beat) — mic OR built-in demo loops (4 kinds)
- Gravity + collisions + spatial-hash physics + global wind drift
- Post-FX: bloom + chromatic aberration + vignette + film-grain + depth-of-field (Bokeh)
- Recording / replay with timeline scrubber, GIF + WebM/MP4 export
- Mouse attract + Paint mode (drag to drop attractors)
- v2 share URL (round-trips palette, FX, audio, camera flags), Tweet button
- Quality-preset chips, performance auto-throttle, debug HUD (FPS/heap)
- Settings persistence + JSON import/export, error boundary, onboarding tour
- Command palette (⌘K), help overlay (?), mouse trail, mobile drawers
- Preset category filter chips, kaleidoscope, hue cycle, click-drop force fields
- Saved camera views (V quick-save, up to 6), camera shake on beat
- Session stats (lifetime presets / gifs / screenshots / time)
- Snapshot gallery (last 8 PNGs in localStorage, re-download + delete)
- Live preset source viewer (read-only, copy button, syntax-coloured)
- Scene bookmarks (B quick-save, up to 12, preset + palette + FX + force + camera shake)
- Custom background gradient (alpha canvas + CSS layer, 6 nebula chips, 0-360 angle, optional audio-reactive hue)
- Slideshow / auto-cycle presets (sequence / shuffle / favourites, 2-60s dwell)
- Crossfade between presets (smoothstep ramp, 0.5-10s, progress bar + cancel, duration chips)
- Reduced-motion mode (auto/reduce/full, gates hue cycle, auto-rotate, shake, orbs, splash)
- Trig-noise particle deformer (global wiggle layered on top of any preset)
- Custom theme editor (name + accent + hue, 12-theme cap, localStorage, JSON pack export/import)
- Touch gestures (two-finger pinch = particle count, swipe = preset nav)
- Rebindable keyboard shortcuts (Settings → Keyboard panel, conflict detection, layout-independent codes)
- Mini-map overlay (top-down XZ widget, click to recenter orbit target)
- Web MIDI controller mapping (CC → 14 live store actions, Learn workflow, always-on hook)
- Editable preset source viewer (textarea + live validate + Compile/Revert/Cancel)
- Live audio waveform / oscilloscope overlay (pinned top-right, peak-aware glow)
- Snapshot grid view + full-res lightbox (4-up grid, arrow-key navigation, persisted view pref)
- Camera path animator (smooth-tween between saved views, loop toggle, 0.5-30s/segment)
- Slideshow respects category filter chips (sequence + shuffle scoped, favourites bypass)
- Bookmark export/import as JSON (tagged envelope, merge/replace, 256KB cap)
- Wind preset chips (Calm / Breeze / Gale / Storm — one-tap weather configs)
- Crossfade duration chips (Snap / Fast / Cinematic / Drift — one-tap blend timings)
- Audio-reactive background gradient (CSS hue-rotate per active audio band)
- Smash & Save — one-tap fully random bookmark scene (47 fields rolled + saved)
- Custom theme JSON pack export/import (parallels bookmarks IO)
- Carousel thumbnail pre-rendering during idle frames (offscreen Canvas2D sampler, ~64/session cap)

## Roadmap (Cake's queue — never overlap with shipped list above)

Status legend: [ ] todo · [x] done · [/] in-progress

### Batch 1 — discoverability + interaction + visual depth  (SHIPPED)
- [x] **R1.01** Preset categories + filter chips  — 2514538

  (+ dee8108 lint-gate cleanup for the demo audio feature)

Note: R2.02 (Echo / trail FBO that survives EffectComposer) was deferred
out of this batch — it's a render-pipeline refactor that doesn't fit a
single slice. Will revisit as its own dedicated batch.

### Batch 3 — persistence + show reel + accessibility  (SHIPPED)
- [x] **R3.01** Scene bookmarks panel (full-scene save/restore, B/Shift+B shortcuts)  — 800f2f3
- [x] **R3.02** Background gradient picker (alpha canvas + CSS layer, 6 nebulas)  — d709811
- [x] **R3.03** Auto-cycle presets — slideshow mode (sequence/shuffle/favs, 2-60s)  — bd78841
- [x] **R3.04** Multi-preset blend (crossfade with smoothstep ease, 0.5-10s)  — 22e4091
- [x] **R3.05** Reduced-motion accessibility mode (OS-aware + 3-mode override)  — 9e4239f

- [x] **R7.05** Audio-reactive background gradient (CSS hue-rotate per band) — 570da2c
- [x] **R7.03** Smash & Save — fully randomised bookmark scene — b9386cc
- [x] **R7.08** Custom theme JSON pack export/import — 12b635d
- [x] **R7.02** Preset thumbnail pre-renderer (idle Canvas2D sampler) — 84c910e

Note: R7.01 (server-rendered OG snapshot endpoint) deferred — this is a
static Vite app, no server runtime available. Will revisit if/when a
backend lands (Cloudflare Worker, Vercel function, etc.).

### Batch 8 — next 5 (refilled)
- [ ] R8.01 Echo / trail FBO that survives EffectComposer (R7.06 — render pipeline refactor)
- [ ] R8.02 Particle attractors as named objects (drag to reposition, multiple types coexist) [was R7.07]
- [ ] R8.03 Custom theme set as default-on-load (auto-applied if active when reloading) [was R7.09]
- [ ] R8.04 Mobile-only gesture hint overlay shown on first run [was R7.10]
- [ ] R8.05 Keyboard remap quick-export (round-trip keymap as JSON via Settings) [was R7.11]

### Future queue (refill when batch closes)
- [ ] R8.06 MIDI mapping presets (controller-specific bundles — nanoKONTROL, Launch Control) [was R7.12]
- [ ] R8.07 Waveform mode switch (time-domain vs frequency-spectrum bars) [was R7.13]
- [ ] R8.08 Preset code viewer: inline error markers on the failing line during Edit [was R7.14]
- [ ] R8.09 Minimap: render saved camera views as small dots [was R7.15]

- [ ] R8.11 Snapshot lightbox: pinch-zoom on mobile (CSS transform handles) [was R7.17]
- [ ] R8.12 Slideshow respect-category in command palette (quick-toggle without LeftSidebar) [was R7.18]
- [ ] R8.13 Bookmark export includes the live camera-view list (one combined file) [was R7.19]
- [ ] R8.14 Wind preset chips become custom-named (long-press a slot to save sliders) [was R7.20]
- [ ] R8.15 OpenGraph snapshot endpoint (server-rendered card for share URLs) — needs backend
- [ ] R8.16 Crossfade chips: long-press a slot to bind its seconds to the current slider value
- [ ] R8.17 Theme pack browser — preview a JSON pack's themes before importing
- [ ] R8.18 Per-preset thumbnail re-render button in the carousel (rebuild a single stale thumb)
- [ ] R8.19 Audio reactive bg: animation curve preset chips (Pulse / Ramp / Hold)
- [ ] R8.20 Smash & Save: bias chips ("Mostly Calm", "Mostly Wild") to constrain the random ranges
